# mlr3hf Submission Template

This folder contains templates to prepare your GSoC contributor test submission for the `mlr3hf` project. Fill in the placeholders and use the files to publish reports (GitHub Pages or repo), then paste the `wiki-snippet.md` contents into the R-Soc wiki page.

Files:
- `easy-report.md`: template for the easy test (otsk examples).
- `hard-report.md`: template for the hard test (Hugging Face -> Task conversion).
- `wiki-snippet.md`: short snippet to paste into the project wiki "Potential contributor test results" section.
- `mentor_email.txt`: draft email to mentors to notify them of the submission.
- `instructions.md`: steps to publish and add links to the wiki.
