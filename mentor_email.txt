Hello Toby and Sebastian,

I have completed the contributor tests for the `mlr3hf` project and added the reports. Please find the links below:

- Easy Task (live report): https://aksh08022006.github.io/mlr3hf/
- Hard Task (live report): https://aksh08022006.github.io/mlr3hf-hard/
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/aksh08022006/mlr3hf

Summary:

- The easy task demonstrates `mlr3oml::otsk()` usage for classification Tasks and includes a small handcrafted dataset to validate mixed column types and role inference.
- The hard task documents a prototype `htsk()` for Hugging Face-hosted CSVs (shorthand `hf:`) and outlines a `reticulate`-based bridge for robust Hugging Face dataset access and streaming.

If you would like access to the repository, CI logs, or any artifacts, please let me know and I will provide them or grant access.

Thanks,
